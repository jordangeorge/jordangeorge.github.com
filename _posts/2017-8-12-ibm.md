I've just completed my first internship at IBM!

I worked on the Developer Advocacy team starting in late May. I learned a lot from the team members. Surprisingly, data science wasn't something I had heard of before this internship considering how hot it is now.

A couple of interns and I formed a team for the hackathon. We didn't place but we each learned a lot from each other and I got some compliments from my front-end design.

Of course, I did a bit of exploring in the Boston area. Some of the interns and I participated in activities such as volunteering at the Greater Boston Food Bank, attending pride, kayaking on the Charles river, and eating at Boston Burger Company.
