This weekend I had the pleasure of going to the TRIWiC conference in Cincinnati, OH with some of my ACM-W chapter. I learned a bit about some of the greatest achievements by women in STEM. I also learned about some of the projects that other chapters and schools were doing.

The rest of the breaking ground project group and I had a table where people could view our poster centered around what we've worked on for the breaking ground team.
