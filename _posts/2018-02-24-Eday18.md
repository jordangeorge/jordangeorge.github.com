The former NSBE president, Anthony Snow, created a Raspberry Pi game designed with the intention of teaching kids about computer science and engineering that could be used at the NSBE table at Engineering Day at the University of Kentucky. I improved on his git repository to include instructions on how to set up the Raspberry Pi, work with python 3, and average the data in a jupyter notebook and output the filtered/sorted data in an excel file.

My fork of his repo and the latest version can be found here: https://github.com/jordangeorge/Reflexes.
