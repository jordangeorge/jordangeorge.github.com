I'm working with a group on a Breaking Ground GIS responsive web application to gather and show data on a map representing individuals experiencing street homelessness to help locate and assist them in the future. We coordinate with the Breaking Ground team to specify their vision for the app. However, we wanted a more concrete idea of what the outreach workers, who are our users, did on a day-to-day basis and what they wanted out of the app.

It's only natural that during Spring Break we drove to New York City, where they're based.

We even had a bit of fun exploring the city.
