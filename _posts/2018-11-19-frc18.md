NSBE's Region 3 Fall Regional Conference was held this past weekend and it was great! This was my second FRC and I'm very excited for Annual Convention in March.

I participated in the hackathon with four other NSBE members in my chapter. Our original plan was to make a chat bot but our focus was divided and so we didn't get much done. We're taking this lesson that we learned with us to Annual Convention and participating in that hackathon as well.
