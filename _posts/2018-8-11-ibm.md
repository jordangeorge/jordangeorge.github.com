Today is my last day in Austin. It will be missed. "Why were you in Austin?", you ask. Well, I just completed my second internship at IBM!

I had a lot of fun. Both with interns and the people I shared a mid-ish Austin Airbnb hostile with for a month before I left to live in north Austin. It was my first time staying in a hostile and it could've been a start-up incubator with how many software developers there were. I tried some nice Bar-B-Q at Rudy's as well as tacos from the Austin staple Tacodeli. I've also been to some places on 6th Street, at the domain, the mall, and a Now Now concert.

There were a lot more interns at this site compared to the Cambridge site. Because of this, I couldn't get to know all interns as well as I did in Cambridge, especially because, even though I was working on a project and tasks individually at both sites, in Cambridge the interns on the same team as me were all in the same room at a circular table. So we spoke daily unlike in Austin where I didn't have any other interns around me besides one but they were faced in the opposite direction and still a bit far.
