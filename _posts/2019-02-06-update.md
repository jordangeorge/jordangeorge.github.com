I used Hyde and Jekyll to create my initial GitHub page.

I then pivoted to a more minimalistic theme that I’m naming “sleek” with node to see how posting blog posts through Blogger would work for me. I got the API to work but didn’t like how the imported css from Blogger would override my custom css. I deployed to Heroku instead of using my GitHub page.

From there I switched back to Jekyll and using my GitHub page with the sleek theme. However, I didn’t want to commit every time I made a blog post. It just seemed tacky and cluttered my commit graph on my GitHub profile and forced me to make meaningless commits. I also started to create sleek v2 which was modeled after a Squarespace theme.

I then switched to Django to experiment with it and use it for the better blog posting experience. I'm unsure at the moment if this would allow me to implement a newsletter feature like Jekyll would. This is deployed through Heroku. It is a bit slow to open at first so I'm trying to find a way to alleviate that problem.

Obviously, this process seems to have been all over the place but I was essentially experimenting with the best ways to make this site happen. I'll leave this GitHub page up for now but will keep updates on the [django/heroku version](https://jordangeorge.herokuapp.com/).
