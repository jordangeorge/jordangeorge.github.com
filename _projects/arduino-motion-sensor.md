Planning to log times that motion is detected through a motion detector and store those times in a database. I will then access that database possibly through a web app in order to display those times. I will use the following equipment to accomplish this:

<ul>
  <li>arduino uno</li>
  <li>wifi shield</li>
  <li>pir sensor</li>
  <li>xbee</li>
</ul>

So far, I have the arduino working with the sensor and am trying to figure out how to log the times in a database like php.
