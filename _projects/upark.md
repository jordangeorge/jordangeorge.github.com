Parking on the University of Kentucky's campus is very complicated and hard for students to remember and follow which leads to a lot of anger and frustration. Two other students and I created this application to tell people where they can park for free so that students will get less tickets and be happier. Our parking app is custom to UK and its permits, hours, lots, streets, and garages.

We are currently looking into getting this app on the App Store.
