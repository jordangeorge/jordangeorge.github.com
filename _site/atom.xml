   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The former NSBE president, Anthony Snow, created a Raspberry Pi game designed with the intention of teaching kids about computer science and engineering that could be used at the NSBE table at Engineering Day at the University of Kentucky. I improved on his git repository to include instructions on how to set up the Raspberry Pi, work with python 3, and average the data in a jupyter notebook and output the filtered/sorted data in an excel file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fork of his repo and the latest version can be found here: https://github.com/jordangeorge/Reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I had the pleasure of going to the TRIWiC conference in Cincinnati, OH with some of my ACM-W chapter. I learned a bit about some of the greatest achievements by women in STEM. I also learned about some of the projects that other chapters and schools were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the breaking ground project group and I had a table where people could view our poster centered around what we’ve worked on for the breaking ground team.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy Computer Science Education Week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK’S ACM-W has joined in on the celebration by hosting an Hour of Code at Glendover Elementary School in Lexington on Monday and Wednesday. In all, over 75 elementary students were able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volunteers included members of the newly formed Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACM-W) chapter at the University of Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hour of Code is developed by code.org and is a global movement to reach millions of students from 180 countries through computer science education. You can find it here: https://code.org/learn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in assisting with the Hour of Code in the future or are interested in joining the Industry Partner Association, please contact Dr. Hayes at hayes@cs.uky.edu.&lt;/p&gt;
