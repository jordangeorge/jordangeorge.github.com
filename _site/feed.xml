&lt;p&gt;UK’S ACM-W has joined in on the celebration by hosting an Hour of Code at Glendover Elementary School in Lexington on Monday and Wednesday. In all, over 75 elementary students were able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volunteers included members of the newly formed Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACM-W) chapter at the University of Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hour of Code is developed by code.org and is a global movement to reach millions of students from 180 countries through computer science education. You can find it here: https://code.org/learn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in assisting with the Hour of Code in the future or are interested in joining the Industry Partner Association, please contact Dr. Hayes at hayes@cs.uky.edu.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jordan George</name><email>jordanngeorge@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Apps" /><summary type="html">Happy Computer Science Education Week!</summary></entry></feed>
